h1. Resque-Sharp


.NET implementation of Chris Wanstrath's "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque, which is a Redis-based background processing framework.


h1. Dependencies

You'll need "JSON.NET":http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx and "redis-sharp":http://github.com/migueldeicaza/redis-sharp. I'll see about bundling those in this repo time-permitting. 

h1. Contributing

This is just getting started and still bit of a mess. The VC# project needs to be cleaned up to point to relative paths for references, etc.  Contributions are very welcome. 

Once you've made your great commits:

1. "Fork"http://help.github.com/forking/ resque-sharp
2. Create a topic branch - `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Push to your branch - `git push origin my_branch`
4. Create an "Issue":http://github.com/chad/resque-sharp/issues with a link to your branch
5. That's it!
